Hey what's up my name is Aldrianny!

I really like animals. Whales, elephants, and all the major apes. In fact, I love these so much I can’t even watch documentaries about them because I get Too Involved. I have this wonderful set of lectures I downloaded about the Great Apes a year ago and I can’t listen to them either. But I will steel myself at some point.
